Hello! I'm Sara, a student currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Ferdowsi University of Mashhad. I find great joy in diving into various facets of the fascinating field of AI, spanning from reinforcement learning and Graph Neural Networks to Robotics, all with a sprinkle of Computer Vision and NLP.

I have an insatiable hunger for learning, and my quest has led me to explore numerous topics. You could say I'm a professional computer science enthusiast. However, there are times when I feel a particular connection with RL (Reinforcement Learning).

Feel free to explore my blog and GitHub to check out some of my projects. I'd be delighted if you reach out to discuss potential collaborations.
